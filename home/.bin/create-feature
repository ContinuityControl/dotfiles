# What it does
This script will create a feature pivotal story and start a feature branch for
you. All you need to do is pass a story name. It will then create the branch
name using a slugified version of the name you passed it.

It will detect who you are hitched with and add both as story owners.

It won't run under the following conditions:
* You have added but uncommitted git changes.
* If local develop is not up to date with origin.

# Setting it up
If you want to use it, you have to add your Pivotal API Key and Pivotal
Project ID as environment variables.

You can find the your token at the bottom of the User Profile page on Pivotal,
which you can get to by clicking your name in the top right corner.

    export PIVOTAL_TOKEN="TOKEN HERE"
    export PIVOTAL_PROJECT_ID="some_number_here"

# Getting Hitched
This script can also detect if you are "hitched" with someone using the
hitch gem (it reads ~/.hitchrc). If you don't hitch the Pivotal card will
be assigned to $USER (note your Pivotal user needs to match your unix user
in this case)

# Needful environment variables
# How you'd use it
create-feature 'Do The Needful'
